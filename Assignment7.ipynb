    "Deviance is a measure of the goodness of fit of a GLM, similar to the concept of residual sum of squares in linear regression. It quantifies how well the model explains the observed data. In a GLM, the deviance is calculated by comparing the observed response values with the values predicted by the model. Lower deviance indicates a better fit to the data.
