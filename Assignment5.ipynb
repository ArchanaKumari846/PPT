    "An example scenario where dimension reduction can be applied is in image processing. Consider a dataset of high-resolution images with a large number of pixels as features. Using dimension reduction techniques like PCA, t-SNE, or autoencoders, we can reduce the image data's dimensionality while retaining the essential visual features. The reduced representation can be used for tasks like image classification, clustering, or visualization, improving computational efficiency and reducing the risk of overfitting in the models."

    "Feature selection is a process used to select a subset of the most relevant and informative features from the original set of features in a dataset. The goal is to retain the most significant features while discarding irrelevant or redundant ones. By selecting a smaller subset of features, feature selection can lead to improved model performance, reduced overfitting, and reduced computational complexity."

Another option is to keep only one representative feature from the group of highly correlated features."
