    "The General Linear Model (GLM) is a versatile and flexible statistical framework used for analyzing the relationship between one or more dependent variables (response variables) and one or more independent variables (predictors) while accounting for the influence of other variables. It is a generalization of simple linear regression to accommodate multiple predictors, categorical variables, and interactions. GLM is widely used in various fields, including psychology, biology, social sciences, and engineering, to model and understand relationships between variables."

Its purpose is to minimize the value of the loss function by finding the optimal set of parameters that best fit the training data. Optimizers use gradient information (gradients of the loss with respect to model parameters) to update the model weights in the direction that reduces the loss."

    "Gradient Descent is an iterative optimization algorithm used to find the minimum of a function, such as the loss function in machine learning. It works by taking steps in the opposite direction of the gradient of the function with respect to the parameters. The gradient points in the direction of the steepest increase, so taking the negative gradient helps in moving towards the direction of steepest decrease (the minimum). The learning rate determines the step size, and the process is repeated until convergence or a predefined number of iterations."

    "\n",
    "Impurity measures in decision trees quantify the uncertainty or impurity of a node's target variable. Common impurity measures include the Gini index and entropy. Gini index measures the probability of incorrectly classifying a randomly chosen element in the node if it were randomly labeled according to the class distribution in the node. Entropy, on the other hand, measures the level of disorder in the node. In both cases, a lower impurity indicates a more homogenous node (pure node) with respect to the target variable.\n"

    "Information gain is a measure used to select the best feature and split point at each node in a decision tree.

The feature and split point that result in the highest information gain are chosen to perform the split.

    "Decision trees can naturally handle missing values. When a split involves a missing value, the data point with a missing value can be sent down both branches, or the algorithm can use surrogate splits to decide which branch to take based on the available features' values. The decision tree algorithm does not require imputation of missing values, as it can learn from the available data how to best utilize the features in making decisions."

    "Pruning is a technique used to prevent overfitting in decision trees. Decision trees can be prone to capturing noise in the training data and becoming too complex, leading to poor generalization on unseen data. Pruning involves removing or collapsing certain nodes and branches from the tree that do not contribute much to the overall predictive power of the model. This results in a simpler and more interpretable tree that generalizes better to new data.\n"

Decision trees are often used as base models in ensemble methods such as Random Forest and Gradient Boosting.

In Gradient Boosting, decision trees are built sequentially, where each tree corrects the errors of the previous tree, resulting in an ensemble with high predictive power. Ensemble methods help to reduce overfitting and enhance model performance on a wide range of machine learning tasks."

Instead of simple averaging or voting, stacking learns a higher-level model that takes the predictions of the base models as input features and then predicts the final outcome. This approach can potentially capture more complex relationships between base models' predictions, leading to improved performance."

    "The optimal number of models in an ensemble depends on the specific problem, the size of the dataset, and computational resources. In general, adding more models to the ensemble can lead to better performance up to a point of diminishing returns. It is essential to evaluate the performance of the ensemble on a validation set or using cross-validation and monitor how the performance changes as more models are added. Overfitting can occur if the ensemble becomes too large, so it is crucial to choose a balance that provides the best trade-off between performance and computational efficiency."
